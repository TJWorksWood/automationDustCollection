# Arduino Code for dust collection using nRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver and two Arduino units

Fully automated dust collection system with blast gate control and wireless communication.

Please refer to the following for using the nRF24L01:

* [Documentation Main Page](http://maniacbug.github.com/RF24)
* [RF24 Class Documentation](http://maniacbug.github.com/RF24/classRF24.html)
* [Source Code](https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24)
* [Downloads](https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24/archives/master)
* [Chip Datasheet](http://www.nordicsemi.com/files/Product/data_sheet/nRF24L01_Product_Specification_v2_0.pdf)

This chip uses the SPI bus, plus two chip control pins.  Remember that pin 10 must still remain an output, or
the SPI hardware will go into 'slave' mode.
